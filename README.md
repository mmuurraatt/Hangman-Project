# Hangman-Project
Hangman Game Project is written in C++ and it is with language options both Turkish and English.


The name of the project is HANGMAN GAME

-OPEN main.cpp or main.exe first!!!

There are three project file we completed in this project. In the main file you are able to see whole project. It has an option for language.
Due to the fact that after multiple tryings a problem occurs and the program does not work quite well at the beginning, so we also split the project
into two parts. The first part is in the JustEnglish.cpp file and the second part is in the Turkish.cpp file. By this solution, we tried to decrease 
the complexity of program and it actually worked. These two programs work without any problem as we have seen. The difference between them is just 
the language option for user. You can try all of them and see they are working fine, but we advice you to start with the main.cpp or directly main.exe file.
